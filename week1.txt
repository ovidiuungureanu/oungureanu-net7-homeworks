2c. Sorting algorithm

We have 10 grades, and they have to be sorted:
9 4 8 2 10 7 6 3 1 5 => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Step 1: We agree that we need to sort the numbers from left to right, and we determine that 10 is the biggest number
Step 2: We will start comparing No.9 on the List with No.4
Step 3: If No.9 is ">" then No. 4, we will Swap them
Step 4: We repeat the Same Swapping system until it reaches a Number that is Higher (in our case, is 10)
Step 5: We do the same swaping system with No.10, until it will not have any number to compare to
Step 6: We will determine the curent order in the list, after No. 10 has reached the end of the list: 4 8 2 9 7 6 3 1 5 10
Step 7: We will Start the same process (Comparing and swapping) with our current first Number in the list
Step 8: We will repeat the processes detailed in the Steps above, until we reach the desired order
Step 9: Final order: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
